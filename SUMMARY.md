**Wind Turbine Object Detection from Aerial Imagery Using TensorFlow Object Detection API and Google Colab** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 488 images with 476 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbine*).

Images in the Wind Turbine Detection (by Luke Borkowski) dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 16 (3% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (80 images), *train* (392 images), and *valid* (16 images). The dataset was released in 2019.
