The author of the **Wind Turbine Object Detection from Aerial Imagery** dataset has compiled a repository containing aerial images captured over west-central Iowa to detect wind turbines. The dataset is divided into two splits: Training and Validation. The workflow is segmented into three distinct phases: 1. Training, 2. Validation, and 3. Wind Turbine Detection and Localization.

**Training**: The training process leveraged labeled 300x300 pixel images extracted from the original 5978x7648 pixel aerial images within the [National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/) database. Every image contained at least one wind turbine, with labeling accomplished through LabelImg. A selection of labeled images is showcased below. In total, 392 images were employed for training, with an additional 80 for testing. This diverse training set encompassed wind turbines varying in capacity, manufacturer, and design.

**Validation**: A set of unlabeled validation images was meticulously separated from the training and testing datasets to assess the model's performance. The validation pool comprised 16 images. It's worth noting that, due to random data and image augmentation during training, validation results can exhibit minor variations across different training runs. Nonetheless, in most cases, default training parameters correctly detected at least 15 out of the 17 wind turbines in the validation image set. While 100% accuracy has been achieved, the inherent randomness in the training process can lead to slight variations in results. Several validation results are provided below for reference.

**Wind Turbine Detection and Localization**: In the final stage, the trained model is applied to full NAIP images, encompassing an area of approximately 4 miles by 4 miles. To facilitate detection across this expansive region, a sliding window technique is implemented to analyze 300x300 pixel images within the original 5978x7648 pixel images. Following this analysis, markers are plotted on the original NAIP images to indicate the location of each detected wind turbine. Furthermore, the latitude and longitude coordinates for each wind turbine are generated for verification purposes.
